# Preprocessing

This folder contains scripts for data pre-processing, created by Group 1. The scripts here are responsible for cleaning, tokenizing, and preparing the dataset before model training.

## Instructions

- **Pre-processing Scripts**: Add all Python or shell scripts related to data pre-processing here.
- **Tasks**:
  - Data cleaning
  - Tokenization
  - Feature extraction
- **Script Naming**: Name scripts clearly to describe their purpose, e.g., `cleaning_data.py`, `tokenization.py`.

Once the data is pre-processed, place the cleaned data in the `data/` folder for Group 2 to use.

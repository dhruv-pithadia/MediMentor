MediMentor Project Documentation

This project is divided into three main groups:

	•	Group 1: Preprocessing the data.
	•	Group 2: Model training.
	•	Group 3: Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.

Each group works on their specific branch, and the final step is to merge all the work into the main branch. Below are the step-by-step instructions for each group.

**Clone the Repository (For all groups)**

First, clone the repository locally to begin work:
_git clone https://github.com/dhruv-pithadia/MediMentor.git
cd MediMentor_

**For Group 1 (Preprocessing Team)**

Step 1: Switch to the Group 1 Branch
Switch to the group1-preprocessing branch and ensure it’s up to date:
_git checkout group1-preprocessing
git pull origin group1-preprocessing_

Step 2: Add Preprocessing Scripts
After writing your preprocessing scripts (in the preprocessing/ or scripts/ folder), stage and commit them:
_git add .
git commit -m "Add preprocessing scripts"
git push origin group1-preprocessing_


**For Group 2 (Model Training Team)**

Step 1: Switch to the Group 2 Branch
Switch to the group2-model-training branch:
_git checkout group2-model-training
git pull origin group2-model-training_

Step 2: Merge Preprocessing Data from Group 1
Before starting model training, merge the pre-processed data from group1-preprocessing:
_git merge group1-preprocessing_

If there are conflicts, Git will prompt you to resolve them manually. After resolving any conflicts, stage the changes:
_git add .
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts between group1-preprocessing and group2-model-training"_

Step 3: Add Model Training Scripts
After writing your model training scripts (in the models/ or scripts/ folder), stage and commit them:
_git add .
git commit -m "Add model training code"
git push origin group2-model-training_



**For Group 3 (Evaluation and Tuning Team)**

Step 1: Switch to the Group 3 Branch
Switch to the group3-evaluation-tuning branch:
_git checkout group3-evaluation-tuning
git pull origin group3-evaluation-tuning_

Step 2: Merge Model Data from Group 2
Before evaluating the model, merge the trained model from group2-model-training:
_git merge group2-model-training_

If there are conflicts, resolve them manually and stage the resolved files:
_git add .
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts between group2-model-training and group3-evaluation-tuning"_

Step 3: Add Evaluation and Tuning Scripts
After writing your evaluation and tuning scripts (in the evaluation/ folder), stage and commit them:
git add .
git commit -m "Add evaluation and tuning scripts"
git push origin group3-evaluation-tuning

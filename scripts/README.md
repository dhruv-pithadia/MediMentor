# Scripts

This folder contains utility scripts, general-purpose code, and any other scripts that are shared across groups.

## Instructions

- **Training Scripts**: Place model training scripts here. Group 2 will create the training pipeline and push relevant scripts here.
- **Utilities**: Add helper functions, utilities for logging, and other general-purpose code that can be used by any group.
- **Documentation**: Ensure that each script has clear documentation so that other groups can understand and reuse them if needed.

This folder contains scripts and results for model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning, led by Group 3.

## Instructions

- **Evaluation Scripts**: Group 3 will place all scripts for evaluating model performance and performing hyperparameter tuning here.
- **Tasks**:
  - Model performance evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.)
  - Hyperparameter tuning using methods like grid search or random search.
  - Performance reports and results.
  
Once evaluation is complete, Group 3 will provide final recommendations based on performance metrics.

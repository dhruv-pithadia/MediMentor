# Models

This folder contains the saved models generated during the training process. Group 2 is responsible for training the models and saving them in this folder.

## Instructions

- **Trained Models**: After training, save the model checkpoints or final trained models here.
- **File Naming**: Use descriptive names for model files, such as `mediMentor_v1.pth` or `mediMentor_final.h5`.
- **Model Versions**: Include version numbers or details in the file name to differentiate between different iterations.

Group 3 will use these models for evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.

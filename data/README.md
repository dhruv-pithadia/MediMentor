# Data

This folder contains all the datasets and resources needed for the MediMentor project. Group 1 will place any cleaned or pre-processed data here, which will then be used by Group 2 for training and by Group 3 for evaluation.

## Instructions

- **Raw Data**: Place any raw datasets here.
- **Processed Data**: Once Group 1 finishes pre-processing, the cleaned and tokenized data should also be placed in this folder.
- **Data Format**: Ensure that all data is stored in a structured format (e.g., `.csv`, `.json`, or `.txt`).

Please keep the folder organized with clear naming conventions for files.
